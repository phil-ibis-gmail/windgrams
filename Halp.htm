The main google maps-ish page can be used to generate a windgram for anywhere in North America. The data source is the
<a href="http://rucsoundings.noaa.gov/gifs">NOAA website</a>. The windgram is generated by scraping the data from that site 
for the next 18 hours. It's nicer because it saves me a lot of clicking.
</br>

<br >On the google maps page, one can navigate around to anywhere you
want, or you can choose from a preset list of launch sites. Once you've found a location you are interested in, 
you can drop a placemarker. Clicking on a placemarker
brings up an info window, which shows a few details about the launch site and a preview version 
of a windgram. There are also links to a nearby forecast, and the NOAA sounding page that the windgram
was generated from.

<br>
The windgram itself shows the winds at elevation for the next 18 hours. Each hour is marked on the horizontal axis, the time
is relative to the current time zone your browser is set to. On the vertical axis is the elevation in meters. Note that not 
all windgrams will start at 0m. The colors show the lapse rate, with the reds and oranges indicating higher lapse rates.
Air temperature at elevation is also displayed in 5°C increments. So for example, on the image below, the air is 5°C at 3300m at 
2pm. The wind is forecast to be due south (180°), and the lapse rate at that height will be -2.8°C/1000ft. 
</br>

<br>
Thats it. The cool thing is you can make one of these very quickly for anywhere in north america! 
</br>

<br>
Note that the grid spacing for the forecast is 40Km, so generating lots of windgrams for close-by points won't necessarily generate
a new picture. Also, the model uses a heavily averaged elevation, so often times the first 1000m of winds will be missing.
</br>

<br>
<h4>Feeble attempt at a disclaimer</h4>
The accuracy of the forecast is always suspect, at best you are going to get a general trend of winds and lapse rates. Always check
the real conditions however you may already be doing that. All sorts of other things need to be taken into account to determine 
if a day will be soarable or not. The data is taken directly from NOAA, so if you don't think it's right complain to them!

I have done these pages more as a project to learn how to make web pages than anything else. 
</br>

<br>
If you know of any similar sources of data for the rest of the world, let me know!
